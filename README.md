# WiCS - How to: Website Workshop 
> This project contains a set of "materials or tools" and instructions (or suggestions) and a base code (which will be completed during the workshop)for participants who are interested in this workshop, which will be happening on March __, 2019. This workshop is specifically targeted to those who have no to little experience with website making. 

## Installation 

No installation is required outside of a editor of your choice. Simply click on clone or download. 

## Tools
1. An editor of your choice (to write code in)
- I will personally be using VS Code but any editor (even Notepad!) will work since we will simply be using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript

2. A Github Account (Optional)
- If you are interested in putting your website live, you can do it for free using Github. If there is time (not likely sadly...), I will try to demonstrate using the terminal but there is very detailed instructions here (by the one and only Github :] ): https://pages.github.com/

3. Motivation to Learn
- This is the most important tool you will need. Make sure you bring it! :)

## Recommended Preparation 
www.w3schools.com

> I personally recommend this website to go over some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax. I will definetely be going over and commenting my code in addition to explaining the logic to website designing.   

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
