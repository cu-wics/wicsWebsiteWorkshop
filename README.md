# WiCS - How to: Website Workshop 
> This project contains a set of "materials or tools" and instructions (or suggestions) and a base code (which will be completed during the workshop)for participants who are interested in this workshop, which will be happening on March __, 2019. This workshop is specifically targeted to those who have no to little experience with website making. 

## Installation 

No installation is required outside of a editor of your choice. Simply click on clone or download. 

## Tools
<b> 1. An editor of your choice (to write code in) </b> 
- I will personally be using VS Code but any editor (even Notepad!) will work since we will simply be using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript

<b> 2. A Github Account (Optional) </b> 
- If you are interested in putting your website live, you can do it for free using Github. If there is time (not likely sadly...), I will try to demonstrate using the terminal but there is very detailed instructions here (by the one and only Github :] ): https://pages.github.com/

<b> 3. Motivation to Learn </b>
- This is the most important tool you will need. Make sure you bring it! :)

## Recommended Preparation 
www.w3schools.com

> I personally recommend this website to go over some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax. I will definetely be going over and commenting my code in addition to explaining the logic when I'm coding, but if you happen to even have five minutes, it will be nice going over the concepts in much more detail. Additionally, I will give out my personal tips.  

## Usage example

Displaying your personal, side projects and showcasting your persona :) in a beautiful and organized manner. 

## Contributing
